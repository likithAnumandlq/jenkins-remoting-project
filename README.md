# jenkins-remoting-project
This project demonstrates a fundamental CI/CD practice: creating a distributed build environment using Jenkins. It features a main Jenkins controller that delegates pipeline jobs to a separate, remote agent node. The entire process is defined using a Jenkinsfile (Pipeline-as-Code).

How It Works

This setup is based on a controller-agent architecture, which is standard for scalable CI/CD pipelines.

1.Jenkins Controller: The main server that hosts the Jenkins web UI and orchestrates all pipeline jobs.It does not perform the actual build work itself.

2.Remote Agent (Node): A separate machine (physical or virtual) that is connected to the controller (e.g., via SSH). Its job is to wait for instructions and execute the tasks it is given.

3.Jenkinsfile: This is the heart of the project. It's a script that defines all the stages of the build (Checkout, Build, Test, Deploy). The key directive, agent { label 'my-remote-agent' }, tells the Jenkins controller not to run the job on itself, but to find an available agent with the label my-remote-agent and run it there.

How to Replicate This Setup (Conceptual Steps)

Unlike a simple script, this project requires infrastructure setup. Here are the conceptual steps to make this Jenkinsfile work:

1.Set up a Jenkins Controller: Install and run the main Jenkins server.

2.Prepare an Agent Machine: Set up a second machine (e.g., a Linux server) with the necessary build tools (like Java, Git, etc.).

3.Configure the Node in Jenkins: In the Jenkins UI (Manage Jenkins > Nodes), configure a new agent node. Provide the connection details (e.g., SSH host and credentials) and give it a Label (e.g., my-remote-agent).

4.Create the Pipeline Job: Create a new "Pipeline" job in Jenkins and configure it to use the Jenkinsfile from this GitHub repository.

5.Run the Pipeline: When the job is run, the Jenkins controller will read the Jenkinsfile, see the agent label, and delegate all the defined steps to the connected remote agent.
